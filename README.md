## A plugin framework for WordPress. This is an empty plugin designed to be hacked and transformed in your next awesome plugin.

This code is used by us, as a start point, to build plugins for http://zerowp.com and other sister sites.

The code is distributed under GPLv2 license(just like WordPress itself). You are free to use it in any of your ** personal or commercial ** projects. Even if it's not required, if you can, include somewhere an attribution link to this page. We'll appreciate it.
